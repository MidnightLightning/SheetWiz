Back in the days there was an online character sheet program named 3EProfiler. However, it died, got absorbed into [Myth Weavers](http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheetindex.php), and forked into [RPG Web Profiler](http://www.padnd.com/3eprofiler/) (last updated 2007) and [web-based character sheet (sourceforge)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpgwebprofiler/) (last version released 2008). Looking at the release dates, Myth-weavers still actively develops their character sheet system, but the other forks have grown silent for several years too.

The foundation ideas for an online character sheet framework/system were great in 3EProfile, though there it could use an overhaul to a more Web 2.0/HTML5/mobile-enabled core, which is what this web-based system strives to do.

Features:
=========
None of these features are fully implemented yet, but are a roadmap for growth, based on the features of the 3EProfiler system.

-  Access character data via API remotely
-  Sheet appearance chosen on the fly by the viewer (rather than set by the owner of the character; allows mobile views)
-  Iterable Lists rather than hard-coded (for weapons/protective items/spells/inventory/etc.)
   -  Drag and drop reordering of list items, or sort by list item attribute
   -  Dynamically expanding lists
-  Create campaigns, and allow players to assign characters to them
-  Advanced permissions for "all users", "campaign peers", and "campaign owners" of the character.

Based on the ideas of 3EProfiler (which died, got absorbed into [Myth Weavers](http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheetindex.php), and forked into [RPG Web Profiler](http://www.padnd.com/3eprofiler/) and [web-based character sheet (sourceforge)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpgwebprofiler/), this web-based system moves your character sheets for pencil-and-paper RPG games into the cloud. 

Features:
=========
None of these features are fully implemented yet, but are a roadmap for growth, based on the features of the 3EProfiler system.

-  Access character data via API remotely
-  Sheet appearance chosen on the fly by the viewer (rather than set by the owner of the character)
-  Iterable lists for weapons/protective items/spells/inventory/etc.
   -  Drag and drop reordering of list items, or sort by list item attribute
   -  Dynamically expanding lists
-  Create campaigns, and allow players to assign characters to them
-  Advanced permissions for "all users", "campaign peers", and "campaign owners" of the character.
